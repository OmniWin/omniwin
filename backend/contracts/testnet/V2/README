1. Create raffle

- create a raffle on main chain only, but you still need to set: const network = Networks.bnbChainTestnet; to whatever the main chain you set it to be
- Specify if you want erc20, nft721 as prize. Comment/Uncomment prizeAmount on Nft721 if you want to mint nft before creating raffle or you want to use a specific tokenId

Command:
npx ts-node createRaffleV2.ts

2. Buy a ticket on any chain

- Set "raffleId" - you can get it from step 1, mysql, explorers, etc.
- Set "network" -> on what chain you wish to buy ticket on

Command:
npx ts-node buyTicketV2.ts

3. Enable raffle on sidechain

- modify fromNetwork (where main contract is deployed) to toNetwork (where you want to enable raffle)

Command:
npx ts-node enableRaffleOnSidechainV2.ts

It might fail because:

1. Contract does not have enough Link to send transactions
2. Wallet does not have enough main token to send transactions
3. Wallet does not have USDC (deploy script adds USDC), so this would be only if you forgot to send USDC to your address
