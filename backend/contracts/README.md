# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# Good to know

## Added a simple task in hardhat.config.ts (accounts)

```shell
hh accounts
```

# Setup environment variables (set, get, list, delete)

```shell
npx hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEY
```

# Shorthand companion

```shell
hh
```

# Compile contracts

```shell
hh compile
```

# Deploy contracts

```shell
hh deploy
```
